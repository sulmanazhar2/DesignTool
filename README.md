# Product Design Tool

This tool is implemented with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, FabricJS and PHP

This was part of my final year project. In my project this tool was used to save designs on server and fetch them then upload these designs as product on the ecomm website.

In this repo there is only this tool which can be used to design products. It's a really good start to understand HTML Canvas

To run this project

1. Install Xampp from here https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html (This will also install PHP) 
2. Run Apache
3. Clone this repo inside htdocs folder. This folder is located inside Xampp folder. You should know the location of Xampp when you installed it, Usually it is C://Xampp
4. Navigate to http://localhost/DesignTool

I will love to create a React JS version for this. Do let me know if that is something you guys will be interested in.

This tool was inpspired from @imomin CustomTShirt https://github.com/imomin/CustomTShirt
